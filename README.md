# Molecular-dynamics-with-NAMD
Perform molecular dynamics experiments (MD) with NAMD on colab

instructions:

1. utilize VMD on desktop or with the file 'VMD_colab' to:
a. generate the new pdb file of the protein containing hydrogens atom, and the psf associate file.\
b. solvate the protein in a water sphere. A new pdb and psf files are generate.

2. open 'Run_simulation_NAMD' file on colab to perform minimization, equilibration and run of the system.
3. Analyze data using 'data_analysis' file on colab
